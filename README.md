# is-your-birthday-lucky

This fun web app takes your date of birth, and a lucky number as input, and tells is your birthday is lucky.

The program is built using Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.


I build this project as a part of a slew of projects in Neog.camp level zero curriculum. The program offers minimum hand holding and the available materials are enough to help whenever need arises.

Please visit my portfolio site for other such projects, I'll really appreciate and thank you for your time.
